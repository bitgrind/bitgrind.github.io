Greetings! Thanks for meeting with me at the job fair I enjoyed our talk about Front-End Development. I'm interested in your position as a Front-End UX/UI developer. I just recently graduated from Epicodus Java and Android track and I'm looking for a Junior development position working with Angular2 and JavaScript. My experience includes JavaScript animation development for the Library at the University of Oregon, front-end UI and design for a small firm in Portland as well as another larger company doing Sass and small amounts of JS for a Power Sports management company down in Tualatin.
    I briefly touched on my experience as a Front-End Developer, but most recently I have been working for myself as a designer and graphics maker. I would design and produce sticker and decals for small business, food carts and bands around the Portland area. I found my own clients, communicated with them to find their wants, needs and any dead lines they might have. I would then design the work, send it over for review, then if it met the standards I would produce it. Before that I worked as a Front-End Developer at Dealer Spike doing SASS styling and JS scripting for a large range of power-sports businesses. I would take a design from the design team and the flesh it out in HTML and style it with SASS, every so often a page would need some JS scripting. Before that I build word-press pages from scratch for a fishing client in Juneau Alaska. I would take ideas from the client and translate that into a website that had the look and feel of Tour business with an booking agent embedded in HTML.
    At the University of Oregon I worked at the Library's devision Center for Media and Educational Technologies (CMET) doing Adobe Flash (AS3) and JavaScript animations. A professor would request that a course to be 'digitized' drop of a booklet of information about the course and what they wanted to highlight in the digital version then we would build it from scratch. We started by wire-framing page by page what section of information we wanted to chalk out, then build it. I would animate images across maps, scroll text, pop-up dialog and then after we show the information we would have a short quiz at the end. Asking questions and tallying scores. I also worked at the Athletic Department Media Relations designing Media Cover and Photo-shopping players, scenes, fields, stadiums, and areas.
    Epicodus helped put a professional developer polish on my design abilities and gave me the skills and know-how to work in a production environment. I'm interested in your UX/UI position, given my client relations, design and animation background coupled with a developer problem solving skills, I'm confident that I would fit well with your team and the position. I'm hoping to find a position that I can grow with the team and continuously be challenged by new problems and positions. I look forward to meeting you and see where we can go from here!
 
Thank you for your time,
-Keith
